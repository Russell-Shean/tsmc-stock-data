## strategy 1

1. For months when the 15th is a saturday, is it okay to use the closing price from the 14th (friday), which is presumably also the open price on the 17th (monday), or should it be the closing price from the 17th?
2. Should the monthly average include only trading days or should it include non-trading days? (ie. should saturday and sunday be included in the average using the closing price from the last day the market was open? (friday))
3. What time of the day do they announce earnings?
4. For days when the 10th is a sunday, what should the buy price be? the closing price on friday? the closing price on monday?

## Strategy 2

1. What do I do if thursday isn't a trading day? 

## strategy 4
1. When I'm finding an all time max, what happens if 2 or 3 days in a row set a new all time max? Do I wait until it goes down again? then mark it as an all time high? what if it's only a slightly daily dip before going down again?
